  "body": "Difido Reports\r\n================\r\n\r\nThis project aims to provide a flexible, realtime HTML report for various functional test automation frameworks.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe solution is composed of different components\r\n\r\n## Difido Report Server\r\nThe server allows creation of HTML reports in a central location instead of the local file system of each machine that executes the tests. \r\nThe server allows connection using a simple REST API and receives the JSONS as the data. In addition, the server stores the data in an embedded [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/). This allow users to create complex queries on the tests results and even use solutions such as [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana) to visualize the data. \r\n\r\nThe main features of the server are:\r\n* Real time - No longer long waits for the end of the test execution to view the reports. The reports are generated on the fly.\r\n* One central location for all the HTML reports with a web interface that allows searching and sorting the different executions\r\n* Allows creating a single HTML report for number of machines running different executions. \r\n* Creating easy to use JSONS from the test results and stores in an embedded Elasticsearch database. \r\n\r\n## Framework binders\r\n\r\n### Difido NUnit\r\nA binding for [NUnit](http://www.nunit.org/), the C# open source test automation framework. The binder allows creating a local HTML reports or/and send the reports to the Difido server \r\n\r\n### Difido TestNG\r\nA binding for [TestNG](http://testng.org/doc/index.html), the popular Java test automation framework. At this stage allows creating of only local reports. \r\n\r\n### JSystem\r\nThe JSystem binding exists but it is part of the [JSystem](http://jsystem.org/) project. \r\n\r\n## Full Documentation\r\nA complete documentation of how to use the project please refer to our [readthedocs](http://difido.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)\r\n\r\n## Support\r\nBugs and feature requests are acceptible via GitHub issues\r\n\r\n\r\n",
